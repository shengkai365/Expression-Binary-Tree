## Expression Binary Tree

### Introduction

An assignment on converting expressions to binary trees implements the following four main functions:

- Evaluates the input as a valid expression.
-  Visualise the generated binary tree with output in the terminal. 
- Save the binary tree into a file; and read the file back in.
-  Report why the expression is not valid

For more details, please see [requirement](./requirement.pdf) or [requirement-cn](./requirement-cn.md).

### Usage

```bash
## 1.clone
git clone https://github.com/shengkai365/Expression-Binary-Tree.git

## 2.run
cd ./Expression-Binary-Tree/src
python3 expression.py 
# Then you can enter an expression in the terminal, for example: ((2*3)*5)

## 3.save and read
# Please check the source code for binary_tree_to_file and file_to_binary_tree functions.
```
